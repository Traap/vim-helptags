# helptags.vim
Helptags allows you to generate documentation for all the plugins you 
have installed.

## Installation
Copy and paste for [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/Traap/vim-helptags.git

## Promotion
I have recently started using [Junegunn Choi's](https://github.com/junegunn)
[Minimalist Vim Plugin Manager](http://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) after using
[Tim Pope's](http://github.com/tpope) excellent 'runtime' path manager,
[Pathogen](http://githbu.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) since December 2014. I was
accustom to using 'Pathogen' Helptags function to generate documentation for
each plugin I had installed; and, since Helptags is not part of 'plug' I decided
to extract Helptags from Pathogen and create a standalong pluging.
